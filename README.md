##Introduction
The Domain that my assignment is based on is the loan domain. So i decide to create a domain that allows users to take out small loans based on their salaries.The system will then use the user salary and the amount of money they would like to loan to determine if the user would receive the the amount they would like or not.

##Description of the Small Loan Domain Model
A Person would register to use the application. The registration process would insure that the person gets added as a client in the Database.
The user would then be able to apply for a loan. When applying for a loan two elements are needed number1 the clients income
(salary) and number2 the a desired amount of money that a user would want to loan out.Once these two elements are received 
the first thing that happens is the client income is used to Determine the Type of client and then type is sent to help calculate the loan risk.The clients requested loan amount is also then sent to help calculate the loan risk. The calculate loan receive date from the loan table in the database which holds the max and minimum amount of money available for different types of loans.At this point the Calculation of loans holds 4 elements number1 the userType number2 the users requested amount number 3 maximum loan amount number 4 minimum loan amount.These element are used to produce a risk report. That Report is used to determine a result that holds the approval or disapproval of the loan.That result is then sent to the Result table to be recorded in the database and also to the Person who requested the loan. At that point the transaction has ended.  

##Key Point

User income is used to determine which one of the three category types a user can fall under namely premium,working and minimum wage. These types are used in addition with the amount the client would like to loan out to determine weather a loan will be approved or not.

The Blue entities namely clients,loans and results represent the tables within the applications Loan database.
